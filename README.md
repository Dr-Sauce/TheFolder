# TheFolder
The Folder was a project to recreate the last flip phone LG made using PowerPoint, so even people who don’t own LG Folder can try it. I stopped working on it because it takes too much time. 

(The Folder is protected by a 255 length password. If you’re interested in continuing this project contact me.)
