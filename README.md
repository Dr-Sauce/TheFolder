# The Folder
The Folder is a project to recreate the last flip phone LG made using PowerPoint, so even people who don’t own it can try LG Folder. Currently I stopped working on it because it takes too much time creating.

(The Folder is protected by a 255 length password. If you’re interested in continuing this project contact me.)
